        <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong class="blue">Flying Eagle cent</strong> is a one-cent piece that was struck by the <normal class="blue">Mint of the United States</normal> as a <normal class="blue">pattern coin</normal> in 1856, and released for circulation on May 25, 1857. The coin was designed by Mint Chief Engraver <normal class="blue">James B. Longacre</normal>, with the eagle in flight based on the work of Longacre's predecessor, <normal class="blue">Christian Gobrecht</normal>. By the early 1850s, the <normal class="blue">large cent</normal> in circulation (about the size of a <normal class="blue">half dollar</normal>) was becoming both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857. It was issued in exchange for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they choked commercial channels, especially as they were not <normal class="blue">legal tender</normal> and no one had to take them. The eagle design did not strike well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's <normal class="blue">Indian Head cent</normal>. (<strong class="blue">Full article...</strong>)
